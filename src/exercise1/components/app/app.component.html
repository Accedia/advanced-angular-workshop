<!--
  Tasks:
    1: Show the posts by completing the *ngFor. You can find the name
       of the array you need in the app.component.ts file.

    2: Add the boxShadow directive to the aw-post component.

  Note:
    It's good practice to prefix your custom components with something
    so that there are no collisions. In this case we use aw - short for
    Accedia Workshops
